# Assignment 1 - Playing with Aha!

Parker Mitchell


## Curiosity
At the beginning, I was at a loss for what to do with Aha, as program synthesis is very new to me. However, pretty quickly I started to think about one area with Aha in which I was curious how it would perform. That is, the difference in Aha generated instructions for code that achieves the same goal but is written differently. This is what I investigated for this assignment.


## Testing

I investigated this by writing five fragment files, found in the *mul2_X.frag.c* files. Here, I wrote C code that doubles the input number in different ways.

- The first file simply computes `x * 2` 
- The second file computes `x + x`
- The third file computes `2 * x`
- The fourth file computes `x << 1`
- The fifth file computes `x * 3 - x`

I wanted to see if these different ways of doubling `x` produced differences in the Aha generated code. I then generated four output files for each fragment file, named with the convention *mul2_X_Y.frag.c*, where X indicates which fragment file, and Y indicates the number of target instructions passed into Aha for that particular output file.

I wrote a small script named *diff_outputs.sh* to diff the corresponding files and show the differences between the generated outputs. So for example, *mul2_1_1.out* would diff against *mul2_2_1.out* and *mul2_3_1.out* and so on, then *mul2_2_1.out* would diff against *mul2_3_1.out* and so on, and then we would move onto the *mul2_X_2.out* files and repeat the process.

## Findings
I didn't find differences between the Aha generated instructions for some of these fragment files, which I found interesting and quite surprising. Before I diff'd, I thought that fragment files 1-4 would all result in the same, or at least mostly the same instructions. I *didn't* expect there to be absolutely 0 differences (besides processing time), especially when discussing fragment file 5. I initially half-thought that `x * 3 - x` would not always reduce to something like `x + x`, because I thought that maybe Aha might think the `- x` might be something intended, and not just some convoluted way to approach the same problem. Thinking about it now though, and thinking of Massalinâ€™s paper, it makes sense that when you are restricting yourself to *n* instructions, a superoptimizer will find the smallest program that achieves the same result as the original program. It was an error in my thinking that this superoptimizer might consider and expression with 2 operations any different than an expression with only 1 operation that achieves the same result. This was a very interesting and enlightening dive for me into the process behind and limitations of a superoptimizer.

## Try It Yourself
If you want to run the script yourself, just clone my repo and run my diff script:

    ./diff_outputs.sh
